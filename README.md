## 📌 Project Overview
The **Crowd Density Estimator** is a computer vision-based project designed to analyze and estimate the number of people in a specific area using deep learning. This tool is essential for public safety, urban planning, and event management, providing real-time or image-based density maps and headcounts.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Real-time Detection:** Process live video streams or static images to detect crowds.
- **Density Heatmaps:** Generates visual heatmaps to identify high-congestion zones.
- **Accuracy:** Utilizes state-of-the-art models (e.g., [mention your model, like YOLOv8, CSRNet, or MCNN]).
- **Alert System:** (Optional) Set a threshold to trigger alerts when a crowd becomes too dense.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, PyTorch/TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Model Architecture:** [Insert Model Name here]
